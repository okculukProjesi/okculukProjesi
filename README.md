# Welcome to our project

<details><summary>About The Application</summary>
<p>
  
  In our Project, we thought of making a unique mobile application that archers can use and that is not on the market. This mobile application will consist of two parts. The first part will be the target scanning system. Here, after the user shoots the arrow at the target, the user will scan the target with their phone and then application will show the score on the phone. These points can be saved on the phone and if the user wants, the user will be able to see how many points in the past. The second feature of our application will be a little bit of style of game and motivate the athletes. Here is also the application will calculate the general average of the application after shooting 30 arrows and as a result of this average, user will assign a random opponent to them and compete with this opponent. These competitors may be world national athletes. Thus, the athlete will both improve theirselves and overcome their excitement before competing in real life.
